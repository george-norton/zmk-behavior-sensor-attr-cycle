# ZMK Sensor Driver Attribute Cycler

This behaviour cycles through sensor driver attributes when you press a button. I made it to cycle through DPI values on a mouse, but it may be able to do more than that.

## TODO

- Persist the currently selected value.
- Configurable channels?
- Cycle val2 as well?
